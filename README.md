Description:

The task was to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger with provided visual assets and a game loop engine by adding a number of entities to the game including player characters, enemies and collectable items.



Instructions:

#In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). 

#The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. 

#The player can move arrow keys up, down, left and right.

#The enemies move in different speeds on the straight path. 

#Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. 

#Once the player reaches the water the game is won!
